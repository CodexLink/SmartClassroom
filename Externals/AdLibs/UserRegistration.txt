User Registration

Normally at this point, registration will be a bit tedious.
Because for each room that you access most of the time, needs an individual scan of your fingerprint.

The library that is currently in use, does not support the use of uploading and extracting the user fingerprints.
We also cannot get the database of the Fingerprint due to some memory restrictions as per they say.


So what can we do is, make user register from the DJango Admin with Administrator Account
Then make those NodeMCU reflash with Enroller Sketch FOR EACH room that is needed to access.

The approximate time to do this is 1 minute + n of rooms in minutes.

Let's say we need to register in DJango then we need to have at least our fingerprint to 4 rooms.
Then, 1 minute + 4 minutes = 5 minutes approximate process time.
