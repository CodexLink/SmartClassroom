How to use Git Bash:

Step 1: Install Git on your PC.
Step 2: Much better to create a subfolder on your desktop for organizing the files. Mine is named "Git" on my desktop.
Step 3: Open git bash and then Change Directory to the folder you have created.
		Example Code:
		--cd /C/Users/'Janos Angelo Jantoc'/Desktop/Git
Step 4: configure the user name and email you use on your Github that will be read by the Git Bash.
		--git config --global user.name "Yourname"
		--git config --global user.email "jagj102999@gmail.com"
Step 5: copy the url of your repository from GitHub and then Clone the repository to the folder that you have created by using this command:
		--git clone (URL)
Step 6: Try to create a file for testing and put it inside the folder of the repository you have cloned.
		--Test.txt
Step 7: now try to add the file you have created.
		--git add Test.txt
Step 8: Check the Status of your git.
		-- git status
Step 9: Now commit the file that you added. (This is also used to commit files your have modified or editted)
		--git commit -m "Commit Message" Test.txt
Step 10: Now push the file that you have commited by using this command:
		-- git push -u origin master
Step 11: try to check the status of your git again and go to github to see if your file has beed pushed.

Done!
